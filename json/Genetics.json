{"cursor":"74907","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Genetics' (from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|genetikos}}, \"genitive\" and that\nfrom {{lang|grc-Latn|genesis}}, \"origin\"), a\ndiscipline of biology, is the science of genes, heredity, and variation in\nliving organisms. Hartl D, Jones E (2005) \n\nGenetics concerns the process of trait inheritance from parents to offspring,\nincluding the molecular structure and function of genes, gene behavior in the\ncontext of a cell or organism (e.g. dominance and epigenetics), gene\ndistribution, and variation and change in populations (such as through Genome-\nWide Association Studies). Given that genes are universal to living organisms,\ngenetics can be applied to the study of all living systems; including bacteria,\nplants, animals, and humans. The observation that living things inherit traits\nfrom their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants\nand animals through selective breeding. The modern science of genetics, seeking\nto understand this process, began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid-19th\ncentury.\n\nMendel observed that organisms inherit traits by way of discrete 'units of\ninheritance.' This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of\na gene. A more modern working definition of a gene is a portion (or sequence) of\nDNA that codes for a known cellular function. This portion of DNA is variable,\nit may be small or large, have a few subregions or many subregions. The word\n'Gene' refers to portions of DNA that are required for a single cellular process\nor single function, more than the word refers to a single tangible item. A quick\nidiom that is often used (but not always true) is 'one gene, one protein'\nmeaning a singular gene codes for a singular protein type in a cell. Another\nanalogy is that a 'gene' is like a 'sentence' and 'letters' are like\n'nucleotides.' A series of nucleotides can be put together without forming a\ngene (non-coding regions of dna), like a string of letters can be put together\nwithout forming a sentence (babble). Nonetheless, all sentences must have\nletters, like all genes must have a nucleotides.\n\nThe sequence of nucleotides in a gene is read and translated by a cell to\nproduce a chain of amino acids which in turn spontaneously fold into proteins.\nThe order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in\nthe gene. This relationship between nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence\nis known as the genetic code. The amino acids in a protein determine how it\nfolds into its unique three-dimensional shape; a structure that is ultimately\nresponsible for the proteins function. Proteins carry out many of the functions\nneeded for cells to live. A change to the DNA in a gene can change a protein's\namino acid sequence, thereby changing its shape and function, rendering the\nprotein ineffective or even malignant (see: sickle cell anemia). When a gene\nchange occurs, it is referred to as a mutation.\n\nAlthough genetics plays a large role in the appearance and behavior of\norganisms, it is a combination of genetics with the organisms' experiences (aka.\nenvironment) that determines the ultimate outcome. Genes may be activated or\ninactivated, which is determined by a cell's or organism's environment,\nintracellularly and/or extracellularly. For example, while genes play a role in\ndetermining an organism's size, the nutrition and health it experiences after\ninception also have a large effect.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Genetics","recorded":1375692652,"links":[],"instances":["genetics","genetics","genetics","biology","genetics","mutation","biology","cat","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics|"],"headings":["History","Features
