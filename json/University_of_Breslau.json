It is one of the oldest (established in 1702) collegiate-\nlevel institutions of higher education in Central Europe with around 40,000\nstudents at present. The history of the contemporary Polish university begins on\nAugust 24, 1945, following the territorial changes of Poland immediately after\nWorld War II. It was established primarily by academics from the former\nUniversity of LwÃ³w, by restoring the building split in two after a severe\nbombardment. The first lectures were conducted in halls with broken windows. At present, the University of WrocÅaw is the biggest\nuniversity in Lower Silesia with over 100,000 graduates since 1945 including\nsome 1,900 scientists many of whom received the highest medals for their\ncontributions to the development of science.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"University_of_Breslau","recorded":1375692524,"links":[],"instances":["mathematician","oder"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1702 establishments","University of Wrocław|","Universities and colleges in Wrocław"],"headings":["History","Notable alumni and faculty","Notes","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["frankfurt","oder"],["józef_łukaszewicz","mathematician"]],"members":["józef_łukaszewicz","frankfurt"],"related":["Public_university","Wrocław","Poland","Public_university","Research_university","Wrocław","Poland","Higher_education","Territorial_changes_of_Poland_immediately_after_World_War_II","Lviv_University","Lower_Silesia","Vladislaus_II_of_Bohemia_and_Hungary","Pope_Julius_II","Cracow_Academy","Leopold_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor","Counter-Reformation","Prussia","Napoleon","Protestantism","Viadrina_European_University","Frankfurt_(Oder)","Roman_Catholic_Church","Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet","Ferdinand_Cohn","Gustav_Kirchhoff","Henryk_Barycz","Congress_of_Vienna","Duchy_of_Warsaw","Kingdom_of_Prussia","Grand_Duchy_of_Posen","Provinces_of_Prussia","Norman_Davies","Burschenschaft","Hieronim_Zakrzewski","University_of_Königsberg","Sokol","Urburschenschaft","Felix_Dahn","Nazi_Germany","Nazism","Walter_Kuhn","Ostforschung","World_War_II","Kraków","Lublin","Siege_of_Breslau","Red_Army","Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_from_Poland_during_and_after_World_War_II","Republic_of_Poland","Territories_of_Poland_annexed_by_the_Soviet_Union","Jan_Kazimierz_University","Lwów","Ossolineum","Kresy","Ukrainian_SSR","Red_Army","Vilnius_University","Lviv_University","Ludwik_Hirszfeld","Bolesław_Bierut","Nobel_Prize","Friedrich_Bergius","Max_Born","Eduard_Buchner","Hans_Georg_Dehmelt","Paul_Ehrlich","Fritz_Haber","Philipp_Lenard","Theodor_Mommsen","Erwin_Schrödinger","Otto_Stern","Stanisław_Kulczyński","Jan_Mydlarski","Edward_Marczewski","Kazimierz_Szarski","Witold_Świda","Alfred_Jahn","Włodzimierz_Berutowicz","Marian_Orzechowski","Kazimierz_Urbanik","Józef_Łukaszewicz_(mathematician)","Henryk_Ratajczak","Jan_Mozrzymas","Mieczysław_Klimowicz","Wojciech_Wrzesiński","Roman_Duda","Romuald_Gelles","Zdzisław_Latajka","Leszek_Pacholski","Marek_Bojarski","Adam_Asnyk","Robert_Bunsen","Florian_Ceynowa","Stephan_Cohn-Vossen","Jan_Dzierżon","Norbert_Elias","August_Heinrich_Hoffmann_von_Fallersleben","Heinz_von_Foerster","Heinz_Fraenkel-Conrat","Gustav_Freytag","August_Froehlich","Otto_von_Gierke","Adolph_Eduard_Grube","Fritz_Haber","Clara_Immerwahr","Jan_Kasprowicz","Gustav_Kirchhoff","Bronisław_Knaster","Adolf_Kober","Wojciech_Korfanty","Emil_Krebs","Otto_Küstner","Hans_Lammers","Ferdinand_Lassalle","Kurt_Lischka","Kazimierz_Marcinkiewicz","Edward_Marczewski","Jan_Miodek","Karol_Modzelewski","Jan_Noskiewicz","Barbara_Piasecka_Johnson","Jan_Evangelista_Purkyně","Eugen_Rosenstock-Huessy","Joseph_Schacht","Karel_Slavíček","Władysław_Ślebodziński","Karl_Slotta","Edith_Stein","Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz","Hugo_Steinhaus","Carl_Wernicke","Mieczysław_Wolfke","Seweryn_Wysłouch","Johannes_Brahms","Wrocław_University_of_Technology","List_of_early_modern_universities_in_Europe"]}
