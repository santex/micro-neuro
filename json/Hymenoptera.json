Over 130,000 species are recognized, with many\nmore remaining to be described. The name refers to the  wings of\nthe insects, and is derived from the Ancient Greek (hymen): membrane and\n(pteron): wing. The hind wings are connected to the fore wings by a series of\nhooks called hamuli.\n\nFemales typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or\notherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger.\nThe young develop through complete metamorphosis â that is, they have a worm-\nlike larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature (See\nholometabolism).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Hymenoptera","recorded":1375692498,"links":[],"instances":["insect_mouthpart","organ","biology","biology","insect","insect_anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hymenoptera|","Orders of insects","Pollinators"],"headings":["Evolution","Anatomy","Sex determination","Diet","Classification","References in fiction","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["order","biology"],["stinger","organ"],["metamorphosis","biology"],["mandible","insect_mouthpart"],["egg","biology"],["petiole","insect"],["thorax","insect_anatomy"]],"members":["mandible","stinger","order","metamorphosis","petiole","thorax","egg"],"related":["Triassic","Carolus_Linnaeus","Systema_Naturae","Suborders","Apocrita","Sawfly","Order_(biology)","Insect","Sawfly","Wasp","Bee","Ant","Ancient_Greek_language","Insect_wing","Insect_wing","Hamuli","Ovipositor","Stinger_(organ)","Metamorphosis_(biology)","Holometabolism","Triassic","Xyelidae","Cretaceous","Alex_Rasnitsyn","Michael_S._Engel","Insect_mouthparts","Mandible_(insect_mouthpart)","Proboscis","Nectar","Compound_eyes","Ocelli","Hamuli","Ovipositor","Stinger","Egg_(biology)","Venom","Caterpillar","Proleg","Maggot","Sex-determination_system","Chromosome","Gamete","Diploid","Haploid","Haplodiploidy","Siblings","Eusociality","Worker_policing","Pollen","Parasitoid","Hyperparasitoid","Tribulus_terrestris","Hyderabad,_India","Sawfly","Sawflies","Horntail","Orussidae","Paraphyletic","Orussidae","Apocrita","Proleg","Lepidoptera","Ocelli","Apocrita","Petiole_(insect)","Thorax_(insect_anatomy)","Play-by-post_role-playing_game","Blue_Dwarf_roleplaying_game","List_of_bees,_wasps_and_ants_of_Great_Britain","Hymenoptera_genome_database","Worker_policing","Afrotropical"]}
