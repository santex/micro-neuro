April 20, 2011.\nRetrieved on April 20, 2011. are not administered by local, state or\nnational governments; thus, they retain the right to select their students and\nare funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition, rather than\nrelying on mandatory taxation through public (government) funding; at some\nprivate schools students may be able to get a scholarship, which makes the cost\ncheaper, depending on a talent the student may have e.g. sport scholarship, art\nscholarship, academic scholarship etc. Private schools are typically more\nexpensive than their public counterparts.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including\nAustralia and Canada, the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and\nsecondary educational levels; it is almost never used of universities and other\ntertiary institutions. Private education in North America covers the whole gamut\nof educational activity, ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions.\nAnnual tuition fees at K-12 schools range from nothing at so called 'tuition-\nfree' schools to more than $45,000 at several New England preparatory schools.\n\nThe secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 (year twelve is\nknown as lower sixth) and year 13 (upper sixth). This category includes university-\npreparatory schools or \"prep schools\", boarding schools and day schools. Tuition\nat private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many\nfactors, including the location of the school, the willingness of parents to\npay, peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment. High tuition, schools\nclaim, is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to\nprovide enriched learning environments, including a low student to teacher\nratio, small class sizes and services, such as libraries, science laboratories\nand computers. Some private schools are boarding schools and many military\nacademies are privately owned or operated as well.\n\nReligiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private\nschools. Some such schools teach religious education, together with the usual\nacademic subjects to impress their particular faith's beliefs and traditions in\nthe students who attend. Others use the denomination as more of a general label\nto describe on what the founders based their belief, while still maintaining a\nfine distinction between academics and religion. They include parochial schools,\na term which is often used to denote Roman Catholic schools. Other religious\ngroups represented in the K-12 private education sector include Protestants,\nJews, Muslims and the Orthodox Christians.\n\nMany educational alternatives, such as independent schools, are also privately\nfinanced. Private schools often avoid some state regulations, although in the\nname of educational quality, most comply with regulations relating to the\neducational content of classes. Religious private schools often simply add\nreligious instruction to the courses provided by local public schools.\n\nSpecial assistance schools aim to improve the lives of their students by\nproviding services tailored to very specific needs of individual students. Such\nschools include tutoring schools and schools to assist the learning of\nhandicapped children.\n","linknr":513,"url":"Private_school","recorded":1375692556,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Private_School_(film)","/wiki/Independent_school","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Government","/wiki/Student","/wiki/Tuition","/wiki/Taxation","/wiki/Government","/wiki/Expense","/wiki/State_school","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Primary_education","/wiki/Secondary_education","/wiki/University","/wiki/Tertiary_education","/wiki/North_America","/wiki/K%E2%80%9312_(education)","/wiki/New_England","/wiki/University-preparatory_school","/wiki/University-preparatory_school","/wiki/Financial_endowment","/wiki/Library","/wiki/Laboratory","/wiki/Computer","/wiki/Boarding_school","/wiki/Military_academy","/wiki/Religious_education","/wiki/Parochial_school","/wiki/Alternative_education","/wiki/Independent_school","/wiki/Tutor","/wiki/Disability","#Situation_by_country","#Australia","#Catholic_schools","#Independent_schools","#Canada","#Germany","#India","#Ireland","#Nepal","#Netherlands","#Oman","#Philippines","#Portugal","#Malaysia","#Singapore","#South_Africa","#Sweden","#United_Kingdom","#United_States","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Education_in_Australia","/wiki/Associated_Public_Schools_of_Victoria","/wiki/Old_boy_network","/wiki/Blazer","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-NEDA-3","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Mixed-sex_education","/wiki/Parramatta_Marist_High_School","#cite_note-NEDA-3","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=4","/wiki/Boarding_school","/wiki/Anglican_Church_of_Australia","/wiki/Uniting_Church_in_Australia","/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_of_Australia","/wiki/St_Joseph%27s_College,_Gregory_Terrace","/wiki/Saint_Ignatius%27_College,_Riverview","/wiki/St_Aloysius%27_College_(Sydney)","/wiki/St_Joseph%27s_College,_Hunters_Hill","/wiki/Loreto_Kirribilli","/wiki/Monte_Sant_Angelo_Mercy_College","/wiki/St_Ursula%27s_College","/wiki/Loreto_Normanhurst","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=5","/wiki/Education_in_Canada","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Ontario)","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=6","/wiki/Education_in_Germany","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany","/wiki/State_of_emergency","/wiki/Gleichschaltung","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Western_Europe","/wiki/Vocational_school","/wiki/Dual_education_system","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=7","/wiki/File:Dhirubhai_Ambani_School.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Dhirubhai_Ambani_School.JPG/220px-Dhirubhai_Ambani_School.JPG","/wiki/File:Dhirubhai_Ambani_School.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mumbai","/wiki/India","/wiki/Central_Board_of_Secondary_Education","/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Private_school&veaction=edit&section=8","/wiki/Education_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Irish_language","/wiki/Junior_Certificate","/wiki/Irish_Leaving_Certificate","/wiki/Boarding_school","/wiki/Society_of_Jesus","/wiki/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers","/wiki/International_school","/wiki/Language_sc
