A shrubbery was a feature\nof 19th-century gardens in the English manner, with its origins in the\ngardenesque style John Warfield Simpson, Visions of Paradise: Glimpses of\nOur Landscape's Legacy 1999:297. of the early part of the century. A\nshrubbery Elizabeth Kent, Sylvan Sketches Or A Companion To The Park And The\nShrubbery With Illustrations From The Works Of The Poets, (London) 1831.\nwas a collection of hardy shrubs, quite distinct from a flower garden, which was\na cutting garden to supply flowers in the house. The shrubbery was arranged as a\nwalk, ideally a winding one, that made a circuit that brought the walker back to\nthe terrace of the house. Its paths were gravel, so that it dried quickly after\na rain. A walk in the shrubbery offered a chance for a private conversation, and\na winding walk among shrubs surrounding even quite a small lawn was a feature of\nthe garden behind a well-furnished Regency suburban villa.\n\n\"Mr Rushworth,\" said Lady Bertram, \"if I were you, I would have a very pretty\nshrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather.\" —Jane\nAusten, [[Mansfield Park (novel)|Mansfield Park]] (1814).\n\nIn the 1980s John Nash's never-executed plans for the garden setting of the\nBrighton Pavilion, illustrated in Nash's volume Views of the Royal Pavilion\n(1826), were finally carried out, in connection with the extensive restorations\nof the Pavilion itself. Virginia Hinze, \"The Re-Creation of John Nash's\nRegency Gardens at the Royal Pavilion, Brighton\" Garden History '24'.1 (Summer\n1996:45-53). Its \"fairly open landscape of soft lawns dotted with trees\nand set with lightly-wooded, sinuous shrubberies\" are best illustrated in\nAugustus Charles Pugin's Father of the better-known designer and architect\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin. watercolor view c. 1822 of the west front\nof the Pavilion, Hinze 1996:46, fig. 1. reproduced in Nash's\npublication. The winding perimeter walk circling the lawn among the shrubs and\ntrees, enriched with island beds of herbaceous perennials, began to be laid out\nin 1814, with a flush of activity 1817-21. Two books of commentaries proved\nindispensable for the replanting scheme. One was Henry Phillips, who wrote in\n1823 The shrubbery is a style of pleasure-garden which seems to owe\nits creation to the idea that our sublime poet formed of Eden. It originated in\nEngland and is as peculiar to the British nation as landscape\nplanting. Philips, Sylva florifera. The Shrubbery, Historically and\nBotanically treated, with observations on the formation of Ornamental and\nPicturesque Scenery (London, 1823), quoted in Hinze 1996:49.\n\nThe formulas for arranging a shrubbery were founded on contemporary painterly\nrequirements for the Picturesque; judicious contrast and variety were essential,\nbut Philips seems to have been among the first garden writers to notice that yellowish-\ngreen leaves in the foreground seem to throw bluish green-leaved shrubs deeper\ninto a perceived distance. Philips 1823:23, noted by Hinze. The\ndesirable undulations of paths and islands and bands of shrub plantings would\nideally undulate in elevation too: \"break up the level by throwing up\nelevations,' Philips suggested, \"so as to answer the double purpose of obscuring\nprivate walks and screening other parts from the wind.\" Philips 1823: I.20,\nquoted in Hinze 1996:51.\n\nNash was at work also on the public parks of London, devising the shrubberies of\nRegent's Park and of St. James's Park, where the German visitor Prince PÃ¼ckler-\nMuskau discerned that Mr Nash...masses the shrubs more closely\ntogether, allows the grass to disappear in wide sweeps under the plants or lets\nit run along the edges of the shrubs without trimming them ...hence they soon\ndevelop into a thicket that gracefully bends over the lawn without showing\nanywhere a sharply defined outline PÃ¼ckler-Muskau, (S. Parsons, ed.) Hints\non Landscape Gardening (Boston, 1971:71-72), noted by Hinze.\n\nSuch precise effects were made immeasurably simpler by the invention in 1827 by\nthe English engineer Edwin Beard Budding of the rotary lawn mower, an\nextrapolation of machinery commonly being used to cut velvet pile.\n\nAfter the turn of the new century Gertrude Jekyll offered a chapter of\nsuggestions for \"Wood and Shrubbery edges\" in Colour Schemes for the Flower\nGarden (London, 1908) in which her descriptions were based on her own garden at\nMunstead Wood, south of Godalming, Surrey, but her shrubbery and hardy perennial\nplantings were design to soften the effect \"Where woodland joins garden ground\nthere is often a sudden jolt; the wood ends with a hard line, sometimes with a\npath along it, accentuating the defect.\" Jekyll 1908:92. In the\nexpansive space of even a small Edwardian garden, Miss Jekyll recommended a\nspace \"from twenty-five to forty feet\" planted to as to bring wood and garden\ninto harmony, \"so planted as to belong equally to garden and wood.\"\nRhododendrons were the stand-by in these shrub belts, combined with ferns, wood-\nrush, lilies, white foxgloves and white columbines.\n\nA Shrubbery is also a reoccurring subject in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\nsee Knights who say
