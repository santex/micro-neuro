It is the\nlargest and the oldest single-payer healthcare system in the world. It is able\nto function in the way that it does because it is primarily funded through the\ngeneral taxation system, in a similar fashion to the funding model for fire\ndepartments, police departments, and primary schools. The system provides\nhealthcare to anyone normally legally resident in England, and also any other\npart of the United Kingdom (should a person from another UK area be travelling\nin England, for example), with almost all services free at the point of use for\nall such people.\n\nThe idea of the NHS being free at the point of use is contained in its core\nprinciples from the original NHS set-up, which are non-negotiable at their root\nbut have variously been open to some interpretation over the years. In practice,\n\"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately fully\nregistered with the system (i.e. in possession of an NHS number), including UK\ncitizens and legal immigrants, can access the full breadth of critical and non-\ncritical medical care without any out-of-pocket payment of any kind. Some\nspecific NHS services do however require a financial contribution from the\npatient. Since 1948, patients have been charged for some services such as eye\ntests, dental care, prescriptions, and aspects of long-term care. However, these\ncharges are often lower than equivalent services provided by a private health\ncare provider.  \n\nThe NHS has further agreed a formal constitution which sets out the legal rights\nand responsibilities of the NHS, its staff, and users of the service and makes\nadditional non-binding pledges regarding many key aspects of its\noperations.\n\nThe current primary legislation is the National Health Service Act 2010 and the\nCare for Me 2012, which came into effect in April 2013, giving GP-led groups\nresponsibility for commissioning most local NHS services, will come into effect\nin April 2013. The Act has also become associated with the perception of\nincreased private provision of NHS services. In reality, the provision of NHS\nservices by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are\nconcerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to\nincreased use of private sector competition. NHS Trusts are responding to the\n\"Nicholson challenge\" which involves making Â£20 billion in savings across the\nservice by 2015.\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including primary care,\nin-patient care, long-term healthcare, ophthalmology, and dentistry. The\nNational Health Service Act 1946 came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health\ncare has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance:\nit is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS\nservices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the private sector started to\nbe increasingly used by the NHS to increase capacity. According to the BMA, a\nlarge proportion of the public opposed this move.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation (including a proportion from\nNational Insurance payments). The UK government department\nresponsible for the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of\nState for Health. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health (Â£98.7\nbillion in 2008-9 ) is spent on the NHS.\n","linknr":659,"url":"National_Health_Service_(England)","recorded":1375692707,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(England)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(England)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/NHS_England","/wiki/File:NHS-Logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/NHS-Logo.svg/180px-NHS-Logo.svg.png","/wiki/File:Entrance_to_Richmond_House,_77_Whitehall,_London_-_geograph.org.uk_-_306901.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Entrance_to_Richmond_House%2C_77_Whitehall%2C_London_-_geograph.org.uk_-_306901.jpg/220px-Entrance_to_Richmond_House%2C_77_Whitehall%2C_London_-_geograph.org.uk_-_306901.jpg","/wiki/Richmond_House","/wiki/Richmond_House","/wiki/Whitehall","/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt_(politician)","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health","/wiki/Sir_David_Nicholson","/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Strategic_Health_Authorities","/wiki/File:NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital(KatyAppleton)Aug2005.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital%28KatyAppleton%29Aug2005.jpg/300px-NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital%28KatyAppleton%29Aug2005.jpg","/wiki/File:NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital(KatyAppleton)Aug2005.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Norfolk_and_Norwich_University_Hospital","/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care","/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare","/wiki/NHS_number","/wiki/Long-term_care","/wiki/Private_health_care","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/NHS_Constitution_for_England","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_Act_2010&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Care_for_Me_2012&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Nicholson_challenge","/wiki/Primary_care","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/Long-term_care","/wiki/Ophthalmology","/wiki/Dentistry","/wiki/National_Health_Service_Act_1946","/wiki/British_Medical_Association","#cite_note-BMA_2007_survey-4","/wiki/National_Insurance","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health","#cite_note-budget2008-6","#History","#Core_principles","#Structure","#Current_reform_proposals","#Funding","#The_commissioning_system","#Free_services_and_contributory_services","#Services_free_at_the_point_of_use","#Prescription_charges","#NHS_dentistry","#NHS_Optical_Services","#Injury_cost_recovery_scheme","#Car_park_charges","#Charitable_funds","#Financial_outlook","#NHS_policies_and_programmes","#Changes_under_the_Thatcher_government","#Changes_under_the_Blair_government","#Internet_information_service","#Health_screening_for_over_40s","#Public_satisfaction_and_criticism","#Quality_of_healthcare.2C_and_accreditation","#See_also","#References","#External_links","#English_NHS_and_related_government_sites","#Shared_with_other_UK_health_services","#Other_sites","#Further_reading","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(England)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/History_of_the_National_Health_Service_(England)","/wiki/Beveridge_Report","/wiki/Arthur_Greenwood","/wiki/William_Beveridge","#cite_note-Beveridge_commissioned-7","/wiki/White_Paper","/wiki/Clement_Attlee","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Aneurin_Bevan","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health","/wiki/General_practitioner","/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)","/w/index.php?title=Trafford_General_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Manchester","/wiki/British_Medical_Journal","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/Douglas_Gairdner","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Hugh_Gaitskell","/wiki/A._J._Cronin","/wiki/The_Citadel_(novel)","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Hinchingbrooke_Hospital","/wiki/Huntingdon","/wiki/Cambridgeshire","/w/index.php?title=Circle_Healthcare&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-NYT02612-12","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(England)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(England)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_Act_2012","/wiki/British_Department_of_Health","/wiki/NHS_England","/wiki/Health_and_Social_Car
