After graduating in medicine in 1859, he began to practise in\nhis native town, but in 1867 he returned to London as teacher of practical\nphysiology at University College London, where two years afterwards he became\nprofessor. In 1870 he was appointed by Trinity College, Cambridge, to its\npraelectorship in physiology, and thirteen years later he became the first\noccupant of the newly-created chair of physiology in the university, holding it\ntill 1903. One of his most famous students at Cambridge was Charles\nScott Sherrington who went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1932.\n\nHe excelled as a teacher and administrator, and had a very large share in the\norganization and development of the Cambridge biological school. From 1881 to\n1903 he was one of the secretaries of the Royal Society, and in that capacity\nexercised a wide influence on the study of biology in Britain. In 1899 he was\ncreated K.C.B., and served as president of the British Association at its\nmeeting at Dover.\n\nIn the 1900 General Election, he was elected to represent the University of\nLondon in parliament. Though returned as a\nUnionist, his political action was not to be dictated by party considerations,\nand he gravitated towards Liberalism; but he played no prominent part in\nparliament and at the election of 1906 was defeated.\n\nHe was joint editor with E. Ray Lankester of The Scientific Memoirs of Thomas\nHenry Huxley. His chief writings were a Textbook of Physiology\n(1876), which became a standard work, and Lectures on the History of Physiology\nduring the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries (1901), which consisted of lectures\ndelivered at the Cooper Medical College, San Francisco, in 1900. He died\nsuddenly in London.\n\nFoster was also the binomial author of at least one plant species, [[Iris\nlineata]] Foster ex Regel Iris lineata was\noriginally described and published in Gartenflora XXXXVI . (1887) 201, t. 1244.  (or\nA.Regel ), which was originally described\nand published in Gartenflora (1887), and later cited in\n[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]] (1888).\n","linknr":231,"url":"Michael_Foster_(physiologist)","recorded":1375692450,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Michael_Foster_(physiologist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Foster_(physiologist)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Foster_(physiologist)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Michael_Foster_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Michael_Foster_b1836a.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Michael_Foster_b1836a.jpg/236px-Michael_Foster_b1836a.jpg","/wiki/Huntingdon","/wiki/England","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Physiologist","/wiki/University_College_London","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/University_College_School","/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley","/wiki/William_Sharpey","/wiki/John_Newport_Langley","/wiki/Charles_Scott_Sherrington","/wiki/Henry_Newell_Martin","/wiki/Keith_Lucas","/wiki/Knight_Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_Bath","/wiki/Doctor_of_Civil_Law","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/wiki/England","/wiki/Physiologist","/wiki/Huntingdon","/wiki/Cambridgeshire","/wiki/University_College_School","/wiki/London","/wiki/University_College_London","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Charles_Scott_Sherrington","/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Physiology_or_Medicine","/wiki/Royal_Society","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/Knight","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1900","/wiki/London_University_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-LG_6_November_1900-2","/wiki/Liberalism","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1906","/wiki/Ray_Lankester","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Stanford_University_School_of_Medicine#History","/wiki/San_Francisco","/w/index.php?title=Iris_lineata&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Eduard_August_von_Regel","#cite_note-trop-4","#cite_note-ipni-5","/w/index.php?title=Johann_Albert_von_Regel&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-curtis-6","#cite_note-trop-4","/wiki/Curtis%27s_Botanical_Magazine","#cite_note-curtis-6","/wiki/List_of_botanists_by_author_abbreviation","/wiki/Author_citation_(botany)","/wiki/Botanical_name","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Foster_(physiologist)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Foster_(physiologist)&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=FSTR870M&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50","/wiki/Alumni_Cantabrigienses","#cite_ref-LG_6_November_1900_2-0","/wiki/The_London_Gazette","http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/27244/pages/6772","#cite_ref-3","http://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA626","#cite_ref-trop_4-0","#cite_ref-trop_4-1","http://www.tropicos.org/Name/100206548","/wiki/Saint_Louis,_Missouri","/wiki/Missouri_Botanical_Garden","#cite_ref-ipni_5-0","http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPlantNameSearch.do?id=438795-1","#cite_ref-curtis_6-0","#cite_ref-curtis_6-1","/wiki/Joseph_Dalton_Hooker","http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/437482#page/176/mode/1up","#cite_ref-7","http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advAuthorSearch.do?find_abbreviation=Foster","/wiki/International_Plant_Names_Index","/wiki/Journal_of_Medical_Biography","/wiki/England","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1258%2Fjmb.2008.008009","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18952994","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Foster,_Sir_Michael","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Foster_(physiologist)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Foster_(physiologist)&veaction=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Michael_Foster_(physiologist)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Wikisource","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Michael_Foster","http://jp.physoc.org
