The Capgras delusion is classified as a delusional\n  misidentification syndrome, a class of delusional beliefs that involves the\n  misidentification of people, places, or objects (usually not in\n  conjunction).

Cases in which patients hold the belief\n  that time has been \"warped\" or \"substituted\" have also been\n  reported.\n\nThe delusion most commonly occurs in patients diagnosed with paranoid\nschizophrenia, but has also been seen in patients suffering from brain\ninjury {{Cite journal\n| last1 = Ramachandran | first1 = V.

In one isolated case, the\nCapgras delusion was temporarily induced in a healthy subject by the drug\nketamine. It occurs more frequently in females, with a female:male\nratio of 3:2.\n\nThe information gathered from studying people with the Capgras delusion has\ntheoretical implications for understanding face perception and neuroanatomy in\nboth healthy and unhealthy individuals.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Capgras_delusion","recorded":1375692507,"links":[],"instances":["conference","medicine","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Psychosis","Delusional disorder","Syndromes"],"headings":["History","Presentation","Causes","Treatment","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["acute","medical"],["chronic","medicine"],["ted","conference"]],"members":["ted","chronic","acute"],"related":["Delusion","Impostor","Delusional_misidentification_syndrome","Acute_(medical)","Chronic_(medicine)","Paranoid_schizophrenia","Acquired_brain_injury","Dementia","Neurodegenerative_disease","Diabetes","Hypothyroidism","Migraine","Ketamine","Joseph_Capgras","France","Psychiatry","Prosopagnosia","Face_perception","Autonomic_nervous_system","Galvanic_skin_response","William_Hirstein","Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran","TED_(conference)","Cerebral_cortex","Temporal_lobe","Limbic_system","Emotion","Amygdala","Inferotemporal_cortex","Episodic_memories","Reduplicative_paramnesia","Changeling","Cognitive_neuropsychiatry","Delusional_misidentification_syndrome","Doppelgänger","2006_in_literature","Face_perception","Fregoli_delusion","Monothematic_delusion","Uncanny_valley"]}
