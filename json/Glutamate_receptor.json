Glutamate (glutamic acid) is abundant in the human\nbody, but particularly in the nervous system and especially prominent in the\nhuman brain where it is the body's most prominent neurotransmitter, the brain's\nmain excitatory neurotransmitter, and also the precursor for GABA, the brain's\nmain inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamate\nreceptors are responsible for the glutamate-mediated postsynaptic excitation of\nneural cells, and are important for neural communication, memory formation,\nlearning, and regulation.\n\nGlutamate receptors are implicated in a number of neurological conditions. Their\ncentral role in excitotoxicity and prevalence in the central nervous system has\nbeen linked or speculated to be linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, and\nseveral other conditions have been further linked to glutamate receptor gene\nmutations or receptor autoantigen/antibody activity.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Glutamate_receptor","recorded":1375692591,"links":[],"instances":["medical","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transmembrane receptors","Neurotransmitters"],"headings":["Function","Types","Structure, mechanism and function","General clinical implications","Conditions with demonstrated associations to glutamate receptors","Other diseases suspected of glutamate receptor link","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["precursor","chemistry"],["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["hypoxia","precursor"],"related":["Transmembrane_receptor","Neuron","Glutamate","Nervous_system","Human_brain","Neurotransmitter","Precursor_(chemistry)","GABA","Postsynaptic_excitation","Neural_cell","Neural_communication","Memory_formation","Learning","Regulation","Neurological_condition","Excitotoxicity","Neurodegenerative_disease","Gene_mutation","Autoantigen","Antibody","Glutamic_acid","Neurotransmitter","Neurotransmitter","GABA","Neurotransmitter","Mammal","Central_nervous_system","Neuron","Nervous_system","Muscle_tone","Synaptic_plasticity","Ionotropic_glutamate_receptor","Ligand-gated_ion_channel","Metabotropic_receptor","G_protein","Agonist","NMDA_receptor","N-methyl-D-aspartic_acid","Kainate_receptor","Kainate","AMPA_receptor","AMPA","Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor","L-AP4","ACPD","Quisqualic_acid","AMPA_receptor","Kainate_receptor","NMDA_receptor","Adenylyl_cyclase","CAMP-dependent_pathway","Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate","Central_nervous_system","Cation","Chloride","Class_C_GPCR","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Glutamate","Ligand","Umami","Western_blot","Northern_blot","Antibody","Autoantigen","Rasmussen's_encephalitis","Autoimmune","Autoimmune","Degenerative_disease","Neurodegeneration","Excitotoxicity","Oxidative_stress","Glutathione","Antioxidant","Reactive_oxygen_species","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Nitric_oxide","Traumatic_brain_injury","Cerebral_ischemia","Infarction","Hemorrhage","Hypoxia_(medical)","Hypoglycemia","Na+/K+-ATPase","Genetic_mutation","Autoantigen","Antibody","Excitotoxicity","Neurodegenerative_condition","Cell_death","Ischemia","Stroke","Seizures","Parkinson's_disease","Huntington's_disease","Ache","ADHD","Autism","Hyperalgesia","Intrathecal","Thalamus","GRIN2B","Memory","Learning","ADHD","Hyperactivity","SLC1A3","Solute_carrier","Chromosome","5p12","Genome_scan","Metabotropic","Paediatric","ADHD","Clinical_control","Copy-number_variation","TNIK50","GNAQ51","CALM","University_of_Pennsylvania","MIT","Agonist","Autism","Memantine","Structural_protein","ProSAP1","SHANK2","ProSAP2","SHANK3","Diabetes_mellitus","Hyperglycaemia","Insulin","Pancreatic_islets","Folic_acid","Homocysteine","Excitotoxicity","Receptor_antagonist","Experimental_autoimmune_encephalomyelitis","Multiple_sclerosis","Oligodendrocyte","Parkinson's_disease","Motor_neurons","Ganglia","Striatum","Autoantigen","Rasmussen's_encephalitis","Autoimmune","Schizophrenia","GABA","Parvalbumin","Chandelier_cell","Pyramidal_cell","Immunohistochemistry","Memantine","Antipsychotics","Epilepsy","Animal_testing_on_rodents","Ligand","AIDS_dementia_complex","Alzheimer's_disease","Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","Major_depressive_disorder","Anxiety","Drug_addiction","Glaucoma","Hepatic_encephalopathy","Hyperhomocysteinemia","Homocysteinuria","Hyperprolinemia","MELAS_syndrome","MERRF","Nonketotic_hyperglycinemia","Olivopontocerebellar_atrophy","Essential_tremor","Rett_syndrome","Sulfite_oxidase_deficiency","Wernicke's_encephalopathy","Anti-glutamate_receptor_antibodies","Excitotoxicity","N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid","Glutamate_transporter","Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor","Synaptic_plasticity","Neurodegeneration"]}
