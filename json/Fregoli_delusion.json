{"cursor":"17286","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Fregoli delusion', or 'the delusion of doubles', is a rare disorder in\nwhich a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a\nsingle person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The syndrome may be\nrelated to a brain lesion and is often of a paranoid nature with the\ndelusional person believing themselves persecuted by the person they believe\nis in disguise.\n\nA person with the Fregoli delusion can also inaccurately replicate places,\nobjects, and events. This disorder can be explained by \"associative nodes.\" The\nassociative nodes serve as a biological link of information about other people\nwith a particular familiar face (to the patient). This means that for any face\nthat is similar to a recognizable face to the patient, the patient will recall\nthat face as the person they know.

Like Capgras delusion, psychiatrists believe it\nis related to a breakdown in normal face perception.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fregoli_delusion","recorded":1375692506,"links":[],"instances":["neuroscience","memory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Psychosis","Delusional disorder"],"headings":["History of Fregoli syndrome","Signs and symptoms","Treatment","Causes","Current research","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["recall","memory"],["p300","neuroscience"]],"members":["p300","recall"],"related":["Delusion","Paranoia","Persecution","Monothematic_delusion","Delusional_misidentification_syndrome","Capgras_delusion","Face_perception","Leopoldo_Fregoli","Delusional_misidentification_syndrome","Syndrome_of_subjective_doubles","Intermetamorphosis","Capgras_syndrome","Dopamine","Antipsychotic","Delusional_misidentification_syndrome","Intermetamorphosis","Fregoli_syndrome","Capgras_delusion","Depersonalization","Derealization","Delusions","Memory_deficit","Self-monitoring","Self-awareness","Hallucinations","Executive_functions","Cognitive_flexibility","Epileptogenic","Pharmacotherapy","Antipsychotics","Anticonvulsants","Antidepressants","Trifluperazine","Levodopa","Catecholamines","Dopamine","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Parkinson's_disease","Dystonia","Antiparkinsonian","Frontal_cortex","Temporal_cortex","Parietal_lobe","Visual_perception","Sound","Recall_(memory)","Semantically","Self-monitoring","Cognitive_flexibility","Mnemonic","Perseveration","Temporal_lobe","Fusiform_gyrus","Parahippocampus","Hippocampal","Anterior_fusiform_gyrus","Ventral_fusiform_cortex","Parietal_lobe","Dorsal_stream","Temporal_cortex","Ventral_stream","Working_memory","P300_(neuroscience)","Prefrontal_cortex","Gray_matter","Neurodegeneration","Semiological","Schizophrenia","Cotard's_Syndrome","Erotomania","Psychosis","Paramnesia","Prosopagnosia","Agnosia"]}
