{"cursor":"3898","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'International Brain Research Organization (IBRO)' was founded in 1961 in\nresponse to the growing demand from neuroscientists in many countries for the\ncreation of a central organization that would cut across world boundaries and\nimprove communication and collaboration among brain researchers. At present,\nIBRO membership includes more than 80 corporate and academic affiliated\nassociations with a combined membership of over 75,000 neuroscientists, making\nit the world's largest organization of scientists and physicians devoted to\nadvancing understanding of the brain and nervous system. IBRO publishes a bi-\nmonthly journal, [[Neuroscience (journal)|Neuroscience]].\n\nThe origin of IBRO can be traced back to a meeting of electroencephalographers\nin London in 1947, which led to the establishment of an International Federation\nof EEG and Clinical Neurophysiology. At a conference of this group and others in\nMoscow in 1958, there was unanimous support for a resolution proposing the\ncreation of an International Organization representing brain research worldwide.\n\nThis plan was welcomed by UNESCO, and in 1960 IBRO was established as an\nindependent, non-governmental organization. IBRO established close links with\nthe International Council for Science (ICSU), a division of UNESCO, and in 1976\nwas given Associate Status (in the category Scientific Unions) in ICSU.\n\nIBRO is an international organization dedicated to the promotion of neuroscience\nand communication between brain researchers around the world with special\nemphasis on assisting young investigators in the developing world. Over the\nyears, IBRO has set up a number of programmes to stimulate international\ncontacts in brain research.\n\nSymposia and workshops are sponsored on the basis of competitive applications.\nUnder its Publications Programme, IBRO publishes the journal Neuroscience and\nthe annual newsletter IBRO News. IBRO offers post-doctoral fellowships and\ntravel grants to students from less-developed countries.\n\nSince 1999, IBRO has run a Neuroscience Schools Programme, organized by the\ncommittees of IBROâs six Regions, aimed at forming interactive networks among\nstudents and teachers during training courses in Africa, Asia, Central and\nEastern Europe, Latin America, Western Europe, and the US and Canada.\n\nWith just three schools in 1999, expansion has been rapid. An average of 20-\n25 Schools are organized annually. As a result, IBRO has over 4000 alumni,\nwho communicate among themselves and schools faculty via their own website\nand Facebook.\n\nIBRO is regulated by its Governing Council, which is made up of over 80\nneuroscience organizations. IBRO represents the interests of more than 75,000\nneuroscientists around the globe.\n\nThe stated mission of the society is to: *develop, support, co-ordinate and\npromote scientific research in all fields concerning the brain; *promote\ninternational collaboration and interchange of scientific information on brain\nresearch throughout the world; *provide for and assist in education and\ndissemination of information relating to brain research by all available means.\n","linknr":88,"url":"International_Brain_Research_Organization","recorded":1375692415,"links":["/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brain_Research_Organization","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Ibro_logoSml.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/Ibro_logoSml.jpg","/wiki/File:Ibro_logoSml.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Neuroscience_(journal)","/wiki/Electroencephalography","/w/index.php?title=International_Federation_of_EEG_and_Clinical_Neurophysiology&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/UNESCO","/wiki/International_Council_for_Science","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Elsevier_Science","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.ibro.info","http://www.scribd.com/my_document_collections/3277825","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&oldid=536006306","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Neuroscience_organizations","/wiki/Category:Organizations_established_in_1961","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=International+Brain+Research+Organization&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=International+Brain+Research+Organization","/wiki/International_Brain_Research_Organization","/wiki/Talk:International_Brain_Research_Organization","#","/wiki/International_Brain_Research_Organization","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/International_Brain_Research_Organization","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/International_Brain_Research_Organization","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&oldid=536006306","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6048819","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=International_Brain_Research_Organization&id=536006306","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=International+Brain+Research+Organization","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=International+Brain+Research+Organization&oldid=536006306&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=International_Brain_Research_Organization&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6048819#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brain_Research_Organization","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.
