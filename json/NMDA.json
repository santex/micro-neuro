Unlike glutamate, NMDA only binds to and\nregulates the NMDA receptor and has no effect on other glutamate receptors (such\nas those for AMPA and kainate). NMDA receptors are particularly important when\nthey become overactive during withdrawal from alcohol as this causes symptoms\nsuch as agitation and, sometimes, epileptiform seizures.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"NMDA","recorded":1375692480,"links":[],"instances":["nmdar_antagonist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neurotransmitters","Dicarboxylic acids","Amino acid derivatives"],"headings":["Biological function","Antagonists","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["apv","nmdar_antagonist"]],"members":["apv"],"related":["Dimethylacetamide","Amino_acid","Agonist","NMDA_receptor","Glutamate","Neurotransmitter","AMPA","Kainate","Drug_withdrawal","Alcohol","Psychomotor_agitation","Seizures","Excitotoxin","Operant_conditioning","Glutamate","Brainstem","Animal_locomotion","Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential","Receptor_antagonist","APV_(NMDAR_antagonist)","Amantadine","Dextromethorphan","Ketamine","Phencyclidine","Riluzole","Memantine","Kynurenic_acid","NMDA_receptor_antagonist"]}
