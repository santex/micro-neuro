They include fluids that are excreted or\nsecreted from the body as well as body water that normally is not.\n\nThe dominating content of body fluids is body water. Approximately 60-65% of\nbody water is contained within the cells (in intracellular fluid) with the other\n35-40% of body water contained outside the cells (in extracellular fluid). This\nfluid component outside of the cells includes the fluid between the cells\n(interstitial fluid), lymph and blood. There are approximately 6 to 10 liters of\nlymph in the body, compared to 3.5 to 5 liters of blood.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Bodily_fluid","recorded":1375692502,"links":[],"instances":["album","medicine","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Body fluids|"],"headings":["List of body fluids","Body fluids and health","Bodily fluids in religion and history","Body fluids in art","Body fluids in forensic science","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["vector","epidemiology"],["sampling","medicine"],["load","album"],["bareback","sex#fluid_bonding"]],"members":["bareback","load","sampling","vector"],"related":["Liquid","Human_body","Excretion","Secretion","Body_water","Animal_body_water","Intracellular_fluid","Extracellular_fluid","Interstitial_fluid","Lymph","Blood","Amniotic_fluid","Aqueous_humour","Vitreous_humour","Bile","Blood_serum","Breast_milk","Cerebrospinal_fluid","Earwax","Chyle","Chyme","Endolymph","Perilymph","Feces","Diarrhea","Female_ejaculate","Gastric_acid","Gastric_juice","Lymph","Mucus","Pericardial_fluid","Peritoneal_fluid","Pleural_fluid","Pus","Rheum","Saliva","Sebaceous_gland","Semen","Sputum","Synovial_fluid","Tears","Sweat","Vaginal_lubrication","Vomiting","Urine","Intracellular_fluid","Extracellular_fluid","Intravascular_fluid","Interstitial_fluid","Lymphatic_fluid","Transcellular_fluid","Medical","Public_health","Hygiene","Vector_(epidemiology)","Sexually_transmitted_disease","Blood-borne_disease","Universal_precautions","Safer_sex","Medical_laboratory","Sampling_(medicine)","Blood_test","Artery","Radial_artery_puncture","Venous","Venipuncture","Lumbar_puncture","Cerebrospinal_fluid","Thoracocentesis","Pleural_fluid","Amniocentesis","Amniotic_fluid","Abrahamic_faiths","Blood","Eucharist","Transubstantiation","Christ","Holy_Blood","Relic","San_Gennaro","Contemporary_art","Marcel_Duchamp","Semen","Andres_Serrano","Photograph","Crucifix","Urine","Andy_Warhol","Marc_Quinn","Blood","Helen_Chadwick","Urinating","Lennie_Lee","Chris_Ofili","Elephant","Feces","Gilbert_and_George","Hermann_Nitsch","Franko_B","Metallica","Load_(album)","Andres_Serrano","Semen","Bovinae","Blood","Plexiglas","Blood-borne_disease","Clinical_pathology","Humorism","Hygiene","Ritual_cleanliness"]}
