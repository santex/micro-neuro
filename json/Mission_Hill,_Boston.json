The\nHistoric District is roughly bounded by Smith St., Worthington St., Tremont St.,\nand Huntington Ave. It is immediately north of the Boston\nneighborhood of Jamaica Plain. It is served by the MBTA Green Line E Branch and\nthe Orange Line and is within walking distance of the Museum of Fine Arts. \"The\nHill\" overlaps with about half of the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, home\nto 21 health care, research, education institutions and are responsible for the\nlargest employment area in the City of Boston outside of downtown. Due to these\nadjacencies, the neighborhood is often struggling with institutional growth\ntaking residential buildings and occupying storefront commercial space. But\nrecent years have seen new retail stores, restaurants and residential\ndevelopment giving the neighborhood a stronger political voice and identity.\n\nMission Hill is an architectural landmark district with a combination of\nfreestanding houses built by early wealthy landowners, blocks of traditional\nbrick rowhouses, and many Triple decker. Many are condominiums, but there are\nalso several two-family and some single-family homes.\n\nThe neighborhood was named in March 2008 as one of 25 \"Best Zip Codes in\nMassachusetts\" by the Boston Globe, citing increased value in single-family\nhomes, plentiful restaurants and shopping, a marked racial diversity and that\n65% of residents walk, bike or take transit to work.
